        Hi, my name is Toulouse, as you can see in bright, bold type at the top of the page. I am the king of my household with two humans and one fellow feline that I rule over.
      </p>

      <p>My favorite pasttimes, in order, are:
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Napping, naturally</li>
        <li>Slowly killing small, adorable critters and birds</li>
        <li>Jumping up and settling into the lap of the person in the room that has the strongest desire to get up</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p class="warning">If you'd like to get to know more about me: <span class="highlight">don't</span>. Please leave me alone. That is all.</p>

    <p class="invitation">Oh fine, if you must bother someone, go see fellow feline
