  <h1>Toulouse</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    Hi, my name is Toulouse, as you can see in bright, bold type above this intro. I am the king of my household with two humans and one fellow feline that I rule over.
  </p>

  <p>My favorite pasttimes, in order, are:
  <ol class="list">
    <li>Napping, naturally</li>
    <li>Slowly killing small, adorable critters and birds</li>
    <li>Jumping up and settling into the lap of the person in the room that has the strongest desire to get up</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p class="warning">If you'd like to get to know more about me: don't. Please leave me alone. That is all.</p>

  <p class="link">Oh fine, if you must bother someone, go see fellow feline
