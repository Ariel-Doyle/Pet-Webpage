      Hi, my name is Toulouse, as you can see in bright, bold type at the top of the page. I am the king of my household with two humans and one fellow feline that I rule over.
    </p>

    <p>My favorite pasttimes, in order, are:
    <ol class="list">
      <li>Napping, naturally</li>
      <li>Slowly killing small, adorable critters and birds</li>
      <li>Jumping up and settling into the lap of the person in the room that has the strongest desire to get up</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p class="warning">If you'd like to get to know more about me: don't. Please leave me alone. That is all.</p>

    <p class="invitation">Oh fine, if you must bother someone, go see fellow feline
      <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/mooska.html">Mooska</a>. I'm sure he will humor you.
