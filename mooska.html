  <p class="intro">
    Hi! My name is Mooska! I'm a young cat and I love to play! I'll chase anything! 
  </p>

  <p>My top 3 favorite things to do are probably:
  <ol class="list">
    <li>
        Playing with almost anything! Power cords? Yes! Rubberbands? Yes! Plants? My favorite! But especially the catnip mouse that will never die and my older brother 
        <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/toulouse.html">Toulouse</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Eating, for sure!</li>
    <li>Okay, napping is great, too, when I can fit it in between playing and eating.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="invitation">
      If you want to play or feed me or attempt to catch me being still enough for pets, please do!
